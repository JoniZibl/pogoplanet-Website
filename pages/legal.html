            However, I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
            circumstances
            that indicate illegal activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
            Liability is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation.
            If I become aware of corresponding legal violations, I will remove such content immediately.
          </p>

          <h3>Liability for links</h3>
          <p>
            My offering may contain links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence.
            Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for such third-party content. The respective provider or operator
            of the linked
            pages is always responsible for their content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Permanent monitoring of the content of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a
            legal violation.
            If I become aware of legal violations, I will remove such links immediately.

          <p>
            I am neither obliged nor willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer
            arbitration board

          <h3>2) General information</h3>
          <p>
            I take the protection of your personal data seriously. Personal data is any data that can be used to
            personally
            identify you. I process personal data only to the extent necessary to provide the website and/or
            app features, or where consent has been given.
          </p>

          <h3>A) Data processing on the website</h3>

          <h4>3) Hosting via GitHub Pages / server logs</h4>
          <p>
            This website is provided via GitHub Pages. When visiting a GitHub Pages website, visitors’ IP addresses are
            logged
            and stored for security purposes — regardless of whether you are logged into GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Purpose:</span> secure and stable delivery of the website, defense/analysis of attacks,
            abuse prevention.<br>
            <span class="label">Legal basis:</span> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in secure operation).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Recipients (hosting provider):</span><br>
            GitHub B.V., Prins Bernhardplein 200, 1097JB Amsterdam, Netherlands<br>

            <span class="label">Note on transfers to third countries:</span>
            GitHub also processes personal data in the USA and other countries.
          </p>

          <h4>4) Cookies / tracking / analytics</h4>
          <p>
            I do not use tracking, analytics tools, or marketing cookies on this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not set any of my own cookies for analytics/marketing. GitHub may use technically necessary
            cookies/technologies
            as part of the hosting operation (e.g., security and functionality cookies). GitHub explains details in its
            privacy policy.
          </p>

          <h4>5) Contact by email</h4>
          <p>
            If you contact me by email, I process the data you provide (e.g., email address, message content) in order
            to
            handle your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Legal basis:</span> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (request/contract/pre-contractual measures)
            and/or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in communication).<br>
            <span class="label">Retention period:</span> as long as necessary to process the request; then deletion
            unless
            statutory retention obligations prevent this.
          </p>

          <h3>B) Data processing in the “POGO PLANET” app</h3>

          <h4>6) Local storage on the device</h4>
          <p>
            The app stores certain data locally on your device (e.g., settings, saved games, progress) so that the game
            works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Purpose:</span> core game functionality, convenience, progress.<br>
            <span class="label">Legal basis:</span> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (provision of app functionality).
          </p>

          <h4>7) High scores / leaderboards / progress via Firebase (Google)</h4>
          <p>
            For high scores, leaderboards, and possibly progress saving, the app may connect to Firebase (a Google
            service).
            The following data may be processed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In-game player name (chosen by you)</li>
            <li>High scores, times, leaderboard positions, level-specific results</li>
            <li>Technical identifiers (e.g., Firebase user ID / in-app IDs) to assign entries</li>
            <li>Timestamps and technical metadata required for ranking/integrity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Purpose:</span> provision of core game features (leaderboards/high scores/progress).<br>
            <span class="label">Legal basis:</span> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Recipient:</span> Google Ireland Limited (Firebase services)<br>
            Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, D04 E5W5, Ireland
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Note on transfers to third countries:</span>
            Depending on Firebase configuration and data flows, processing/transfer outside the EU/EEA (e.g., USA) may
            occur.
            In such cases, the transfer is based on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses), where
            required.
          </p>

          <h4>8) Advertising / rewarded ads (if enabled in the app)</h4>
          <p>
            The app may include advertisements, in particular rewarded ads (a reward after voluntarily viewing an ad).
            Depending on the advertising SDK used and device settings, device and usage data may be processed
            (e.g., advertising ID, device type/OS version, IP address, interaction data).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="label">Purpose:</span> financing the app and providing optional reward mechanics.<br>
            <span class="label">Legal bases (depending on implementation):</span><br>
            Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (if you voluntarily start a rewarded ad to receive an in-game reward)<br>
            Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent), where personalized advertising/tracking or consent under applicable rules is
            required
          </p>

          <h4>9) Analytics / Crashlytics</h4>
          <p>
            Not enabled. No analytics or Crashlytics services are currently used (no usage analytics, no automatic crash
            reports).
          </p>

          <h3>10) Retention period</h3>
          <p>
            I store personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes stated:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Website:</strong> IP/server logs are stored by GitHub Pages for security purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>App (leaderboards/high scores):</strong> as long as your profile/entry is needed (e.g., until
              deletion upon request, unless overriding reasons apply).</li>
            <li><strong>Emails:</strong> as long as necessary for processing and any follow-up questions; then deletion
              unless obligations prevent this.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>11) Your rights</h3>
          <p>You have the following rights (subject to applicable conditions):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent (Art. 7(3) GDPR)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To exercise your rights, simply email:
            <a href="mailto:joni.zibl@gmail.com">joni.zibl@gmail.com</a><br>
            If your request relates to app data/high scores, it helps if you include your in-game name and—if
            available—a profile/user
            identifier so I can clearly match the data.
          </p>

          <h3>Automated decisions / profiling</h3>
          <p>
            I do not carry out automated decision-making or profiling within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR.
          </p>

          <h3>Requirement to provide data</h3>
          <p>
            Providing data is generally voluntary. However, without an in-game name and score/leaderboard data,
            leaderboard and high-score features cannot be used.
          </p>

          <h3>12) Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h3>
          <p>
            If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data protection law, you have the right to
            lodge a
            complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR). For North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), for example:
          </p>
          <p>
            State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information North Rhine-Westphalia (LDI NRW)<br>
            P.O. Box 20 04 44, 40102 Düsseldorf<br>
            Kavalleriestraße 2–4, 40213 Düsseldorf<br>
            Email: <a href="mailto:poststelle@ldi.nrw.de">poststelle@ldi.nrw.de</a>
          </p>

          <h3>13) Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
          <p>
            This privacy policy may be adjusted if website/app features or legal requirements change.
            The current version published on this page applies.
